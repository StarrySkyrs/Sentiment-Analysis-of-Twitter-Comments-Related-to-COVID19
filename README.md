## Project description 
Twitter has one of the most significant microblogging social media in the world. For Twitter. users, it has become a norm to use tweets and comments limited by the number of characters to express their lives and emotions. During the COVID-19 pandemic that started in December 2019, a significant number of COVID related comments are spread every day through different social media and Twitter. With the trend of the pandemic, analyzing public sentiment data in the comments can also help understand the public's emotional changes during the epidemic, helping understand the public's perception of the epidemic. In our project, we plan to make a sentiment analysis of tweets based on a monthly comparison. We use python programming language to extract tweets about Covid-19 from August 2020 to the end of March 2021 from the coronavirus-related tweets database. We use Naive Bayes' algorithm and a database of known positive and negative sentiment tweets to train the classifier to distinguish between positive tweets and negative tweets to a certain extent. When completing sentiment analysis, our classifier accuracy is about 67%.
