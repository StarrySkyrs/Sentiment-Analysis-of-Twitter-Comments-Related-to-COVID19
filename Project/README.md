Description:

We plan to conduct sentiment analysis on Twitter comments related to Covid-19 to analyze the comment text's sentiment direction.
We plan to divide emotions into three types: positive, neutral and negative.
Determine the emotion contained in the text by analyzing the text to obtain the relative emotion percentage.
The data we plan to use comes from the COVID-19 Twitter Chatter dataset, retrieved from https://metatext.io/datasets/covid-19-twitter-chatter-dataset.
We plan to try using python, CNN and LSTM model in sentiment analysis, but we have not finally decided on the methods we will use.
